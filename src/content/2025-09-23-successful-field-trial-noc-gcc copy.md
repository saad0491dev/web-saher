# Successful field trial with a major NOC in the GCC region

**Saher Flow Solutions has successfully completed a field trial in collaboration with one of the major National Oil Companies (NOCs) in the GCC.** Our compact, skid-mounted, non-radioactive Multiphase Flow Meter (MPFM) demonstrated reliable, field-grade performance — meeting and in many cases exceeding the end-user's accuracy targets for water-cut and liquid flow rate.

## Trial overview

The field trial directly compared Saher's MPFM against a portable test (liquid–gas) separator used by the operator. Tests were performed under realistic operational conditions to validate the MPFM's accuracy, robustness, and suitability for deployment in demanding oilfield environments.

## Key outcomes

- **Accuracy:** The MPFM met and often surpassed the operator's water-cut and liquid flow rate accuracy targets.  
- **Direct comparison:** Performance was benchmarked against a portable separator and produced consistently reliable results.  
- **Operational robustness:** The skid-mounted design performed well under field conditions — demonstrating durability, ease of installation, and dependable data delivery.  
- **Non-radioactive advantage:** The MPFM delivers high-quality multiphase measurements without radioactive sources, simplifying logistics, safety, and regulatory compliance.

## Why choose Saher's MPFM?

- **Safe (non-radioactive):** Eliminates complexity and hazard associated with radioactive sources.  
- **Compact & skid-mounted:** Easy transport, installation, and integration into existing facilities.  
- **Accurate measurement:** Validated accuracy for water-cut and liquid flow rate in real field conditions.  
- **Reliable & durable:** Built to withstand typical oilfield environments and provide continuous measurements.
